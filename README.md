## Pick a colour with your nose!
The screen will start with four squares of different colours, use your nose to pick a colour, and then the circle on your nose will  become that colour! If you begin the screen without being on a square, the circle will be black.

### Inspiration
I drew my inspiration from [here](https://p5js.org/examples/input-rollover.html)
I wanted to make a program where you could actually draw with your nose rather than just have a circle with a trail, but there is no easy way to convert the 'mousePressed' to something that actually works with your nose. 
I also hoped that I would be able to make the sqaure colours rotate beetween the 4 and still be able to have the circle remain whatever colour the sqaure that it touched was, but I was unable to figure out how to use millis() with the camera.
Here is a video of it in action:
